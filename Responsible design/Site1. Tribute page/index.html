                </p>
                <p>
                    <li><strong>1939</strong> - He earned his medical degree from the New York University School of
                        Medicine and became a scientist physician at Mount Sinai Hospital. The day after his graduation
                        from medical school in 1939, Salk married Donna Lindsay, a master's candidate at the New York
                        College of Social Work.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li><strong>1942</strong> - Salk went to the University of Michigan on a research fellowship to
                        develop an influenza vaccine.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li><strong>1947</strong> - Salk was appointed director of the Virus Research Laboratory at the
                        University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. With funding from the National Foundation for
                        Infantile Paralysis — now known as the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation —he began to
                        develop the techniques that would lead to a vaccine to wipe out the most frightening scourge of
                        the time: paralytic poliomyelitis.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li><strong>1954</strong> - National testing of Salk's vaccine began on one million children, ages
                        six to nine, who became known as the Polio Pioneers.</li>

                <p>
                    <li><strong>1955</strong> - The results were announced: the vaccine was safe and effective. Hailed
                        as a miracle worker, Salk never patented the vaccine or earned any money from his discovery,
                        preferring it be distributed as widely as possible.
                        Salk's inactivated polio vaccine is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential
                        Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system.</li>
                </p>

                        discontinued in 2007, twelve years after Salk's death.</li>
